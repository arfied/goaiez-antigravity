# Messages Pricing

Outbound messages bill per message per month. The first 10,000 are free, then $1 per 10,000 across every inbox channel, starting 1 October 2026.

The message meter starts 1 October 2026. From that date every message Zernio delivers to a recipient on your behalf meters, whichever endpoint sends it: the [Inbox API](/messages/send-inbox-message), the [Broadcasts API](/broadcasts/create-broadcast), sequences, workflows and the per-platform send endpoints. The first 10,000 each month are free, then $0.0001 per message ($1 per 10,000). One meter covers every inbox channel. Sends before 1 October 2026 are counted but never billed, and nothing pauses at the free allowance until then.

## What counts as a message

Only messages leaving your account count. Everything you receive is free, replies to comments and reviews are free, and the 2 channels that already bill per message are excluded.

| Action | Meters? |
|---|---|
| DM sent, on any channel except X and SMS (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Reddit, Bluesky, Discord) | Yes |
| WhatsApp broadcast, per recipient | Yes |
| WhatsApp [flow](/platforms/whatsapp/flows) or sequence message sent | Yes |
| X (platform value `twitter`) DM sent | No, billed at [X's pass-through rate](/pricing#x-twitter-api-usage) |
| SMS sent | No, billed [per segment](/pricing/sms) |
| Any message received | No |
| Comment reply, review reply | No |
| Reading conversations, messages, comments and reviews | No |
| Typing indicators, read receipts, marking a conversation read | No |

X DMs and SMS are excluded outright: they do not bill on this meter and they do not consume your 10,000. A failed send does not bill either.

Broadcasts count per recipient. A broadcast is one API call, but it meters once per contact it reaches. A broadcast to 5,000 recipients is 5,000 messages, so it uses half the monthly allowance in a single send. Meta's template fees are unchanged and still bill [directly to your WABA](/pricing/whatsapp); this meter is Zernio's line on top.

## Examples

| Messages sent per month | Monthly cost |
|---|---|
| 8,000 | Free |
| 10,000 | Free |
| 50,000 | $4.00 |
| 250,000 | $24.00 |
| 1,000,000 | $99.00 |

## Scope and mechanics

- The allowance is per team, not per account: sends from every connected account and from every team member roll up to one team total on the team owner's invoice. Free teams (1 to 2 connected accounts) get the same 10,000.
- It resets at 00:00 UTC on the 1st of each calendar month and does not roll over. Unlike connected accounts, messages are not prorated: you get the full 10,000 in the month you sign up, and every message either counts this month or it does not.
- No endpoint reports the running count today. `GET /v1/usage` and `GET /v1/usage-stats` carry connected accounts and X API calls, not messages. Two signals exist instead: with no card on file, Zernio emails the team owner at 7,500 messages, and the send that would pass 10,000 fails with `403`, code `message_allowance_exceeded`. With a card on file nothing pauses and the overage meters at $1 per 10,000.
- It appears on your invoice as Managed Messages, itemized like every other meter. See [How billing works](/billing) for the mechanics.
