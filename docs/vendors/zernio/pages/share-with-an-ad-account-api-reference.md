# Share with an ad account API Reference

Shares the pixel with another ad account so campaigns/audiences in that
account can use it. Requires that you administer both the pixel's owning
Business Manager and the target ad account; a pixel on a personal
(non-BM) ad account can't be shared (Meta will reject the call). Meta
only (platform `metaads`); other platforms return 405.
