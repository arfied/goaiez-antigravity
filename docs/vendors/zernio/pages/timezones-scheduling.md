# Timezones & Scheduling

Schedule a post at a local wall-clock time with scheduledFor and timezone, and read back the UTC instant Zernio stores.

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

`scheduledFor` with a `Z` or an offset is an absolute instant. Without one, Zernio reads it as local time in the `timezone` field, which defaults to `UTC`. Posts that publish at the wrong hour are local times sent without a `timezone`.

## First call

Schedule a post at 9:00 in the user's timezone by passing the wall-clock time they picked and their IANA timezone. In a browser, `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone` returns it.

## How it behaves

### Zernio reads `scheduledFor` in `timezone` only when it has no zone

[Create post](/posts/create-post) reads `scheduledFor` like this:

| You send | Interpreted as |
|----------|---------------|
| `"2027-01-01T10:00:00Z"` | Absolute UTC instant. `timezone` is ignored. |
| `"2027-01-01T10:00:00+01:00"` | Absolute instant with an explicit offset. `timezone` is ignored. |
| `"2027-01-01T10:00:00"` (no zone) | Local wall-clock time in the request's `timezone` (IANA name, default `UTC`). |
| `"2027-03-14T02:30:00"` with `timezone: "America/New_York"`, a local time the spring-forward skips | Accepted, not rejected. Zernio applies the offset that zone is in at 02:30 UTC that day, `-05:00`, and stores `2027-03-14T07:30:00Z`, which is 03:30 local. |
| `"2027-11-07T01:30:00"` with `timezone: "America/New_York"`, a local time the fall-back repeats | Accepted. The same rule applies `-04:00` and stores `2027-11-07T05:30:00Z`, the first of the two 01:30s. |

These 3 requests schedule the same instant:

```json
{ "scheduledFor": "2027-01-01T09:00:00Z" }
{ "scheduledFor": "2027-01-01T10:00:00+01:00" }
{ "scheduledFor": "2027-01-01T10:00:00", "timezone": "Europe/Madrid" }
```

A local time with no `timezone` is read as UTC. A user who picked 10:00 in Madrid and whose request carries only `"scheduledFor": "2027-01-01T10:00:00"` gets a post at 10:00 UTC, which is 11:00 in Madrid. A `scheduledFor` already in the past is published synchronously in the same request.

Neither DST case is an error, and neither follows a gap or repeat rule: the offset comes from reading your wall-clock time as UTC, so a local time on a DST change day can resolve an hour from the one you meant. Send `Z` or an explicit offset when you schedule on one.

### Zernio returns times in UTC

`scheduledFor` and `publishedAt` come back as UTC ISO 8601 with a `Z`, whatever you sent. Convert to the viewer's timezone when you display them.

### Queue slots follow the queue's timezone

A [queue](/guides/queue-scheduling) carries its own `timezone`, independent of any post-level field. Each slot is a day of week plus a wall-clock time in that timezone:

```json
{
  "profileId": "66a1f0c2a4b9d3e8f1a2b3c4",
  "name": "Evening posts",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "slots": [
    { "dayOfWeek": 1, "time": "18:00" },
    { "dayOfWeek": 3, "time": "18:00" },
    { "dayOfWeek": 5, "time": "18:00" }
  ]
}
```

`dayOfWeek` is `0` (Sunday) through `6` (Saturday) and `time` is `HH:mm` in the queue's timezone. Slots track the local wall clock through DST changes: an 18:00 New York slot stays at 18:00 New York time all year while its UTC instant moves by an hour. A post created with `queuedFromProfile` gets its `scheduledFor` from the next free slot, so you send no time at all.

### A per-platform `scheduledFor` overrides the root one

Each entry in `platforms[]` accepts its own `scheduledFor`, so the same post can go out at different times per platform. A root `timezone` applies to the overrides too, so the LinkedIn entry below publishes at 09:00 New York time and the Instagram one at 18:00 the same day:

```json
{
  "content": "Our January release notes are out.",
  "scheduledFor": "2027-01-01T09:00:00",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "platforms": [
    { "platform": "linkedin", "accountId": "66b2e19d8c3f5a7e9d0b1c2d" },
    {
      "platform": "instagram",
      "accountId": "66b2e19d8c3f5a7e9d0b1c2e",
      "scheduledFor": "2027-01-01T18:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

An override written as an absolute time (`Z` or an offset) is taken as it stands, whatever `timezone` says.

## If it fails

A `400` on `POST /v1/posts` means `timezone` is not an IANA name Zernio recognizes, such as `Europe/Madird`:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid timezone provided"
}
```

Send a canonical IANA name (`Europe/Madrid`, `America/New_York`). The check runs only when `scheduledFor` is set. This response predates the error envelope and carries no `type` or `code`. `POST /v1/queue/slots` validates the same field through the envelope instead, with `code: "invalid_field_value"` and `param: "timezone"`.
