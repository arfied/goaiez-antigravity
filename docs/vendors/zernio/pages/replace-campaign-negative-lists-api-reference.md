# Replace campaign negative lists API Reference

Sets the full desired set of shared negative keyword list associations on this campaign. Send listIds=[] to detach all negative keyword lists. Only campaign_shared_set links are changed; the lists and their keywords are preserved. Every list must belong to the campaign customer and have type NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS.

## GET /v1/ads/campaigns/{campaignId}/negative-keyword-lists

**List campaign negative lists**

Returns shared negative keyword lists attached to the campaign, separate from campaign-level negative keywords. Google Ads shared negative keyword lists (shared_set type NEGATIVE_KEYWORDS). Reads are cached for 10 minutes; quota exhaustion may return the last successful result for up to 7 days with stale=true. Customer selection is limited to this connection and its account scope.

- **platform** `string`: Upstream platform (e.g. meta, google, tiktok), present when type is platform_error.

integrators can read provider-specific codes. For Meta this includes
error_subcode, error_user_title, and error_user_msg.

- **details** `object`: Additional structured context (e.g. field-level validation errors), for example `privateReplyConsumed` on the private-reply endpoint's 400 when the comment's single reply is already spent.
